# Health Monitoring Data Analysis

## Overview
This project performs data analysis on health monitoring data using Python. The dataset contains vital health parameters such as body temperature, oxygen saturation, heart rate, and respiratory rate. The project focuses on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to identify trends and insights.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values using median imputation.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Summary statistics
  - Distribution plots of numerical features (age, heart rate, respiratory rate, body temperature, SpO2)
  - Correlation heatmap
- **Visualizations**: Histogram plots, KDE plots, and heatmaps using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project should be placed in the root directory as `healthmonitoring.csv`. The data includes:
- **Age**
- **Heart Rate**
- **Respiratory Rate**
- **Body Temperature**
- **Oxygen Saturation (SpO2)**

## Usage
- Run the notebook to clean and analyze the data.
- Visualizations help in understanding distributions and correlations between health metrics.
- Insights can be used for further predictive modeling or health assessments.

## Results
- Identified trends in health parameters.
- Visualized distributions and correlations among different features.
- Provided a cleaner dataset for further analysis.

## Conclusion
This project provides a foundational approach to analyzing health monitoring data, highlighting trends and correlations that can be leveraged for deeper research or predictive modeling. By employing effective data cleaning and visualization techniques, it enables better understanding of key health indicators.
